----------------DESCRIPTION----------------
This game is a simple mini golf game that uses Unity3D.
The main goal of this was to create a mini-golf mechanic from scratch.
Once this was achieved, I practiced modular level design.
Although, not very complicated, the level can be made by just about anyone inside the game editor, as all the prefabs used to make the levels click together.
Lastly, I used post processing to make the game a little more visually pleasing (color correction, depth of field, etc).
