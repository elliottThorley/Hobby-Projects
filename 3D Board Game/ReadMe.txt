----------------DESCRIPTION----------------
A template for making a 3D board game, in the style of candyland.
I focused on making the movement of everything as smooth as possible in this.
The movement of the camera is automatic which is something I wanted to experiment with.
The text bubbles are currently empty as this is just a template.
Given more time I would have fixed text bubble overlapping with objects.
An additional feature I would like to have added is a victory screen for whoever gets to the last tile first.

----------------CONTROLS----------------
Space: Pull color card(move to X color)
Y/N: Y=player stays at that roll, next players turn
     N=player fails roll, return to previous position, next players turn

----------------Assets----------------
Water Shader from asset store
everything else is made by me
