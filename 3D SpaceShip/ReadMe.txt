----------------DESCRIPTION----------------
The point of this project is to create an arcade space ship controller.
If expanded upon, adding a shooting functionality to break astroids would be cool.

----------------CONTROLS----------------
Q+E: air roll left and right
A+D: turn left and right
W+S: tilt up and down
Space+Ctrl: forward and reverse

----------------Assets----------------
Skybox is from asset store
Everything else is made by me
