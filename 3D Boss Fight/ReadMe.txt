----------------DESCRIPTION----------------
This game is a third person fighting game with 1 boss fight.
I placed emphasis on trying to make everything as dramatic as possible.
To accomplish this I did:
	oversized enviroment
	zoomed out camera to showcase enviroment
	have the boss fight floor shoot into the air
	stylistic color scheme
	camera shake on boss attacks hitting ground
	
Features:
	sword attack animation
	arrow attack
	basic walking movement
	dash movement+VFX
	boss AI
	location based camera movement

Gameplay:
The player is unable to die as this is just to show off the idea, not actually be a game.
The boss has 3 different attack types it can do:
	Anticross sword throw
	3 swords throw
	pyramid sword throw
The boss is set to "die" after 3 hits with an arrow
	when dead an effect plays and then stops attacking

After the boss fight a door opens, that leads to an infinite bridge if the player walks on it
	this was made to lead to the next area as it goes into a white void and could easily be implemented
